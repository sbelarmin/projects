"Doctor: Hello! I see that you were referred to our hospital for a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in your right upper lobe. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: We have planned a UVATS procedure to resect the tumor. Are you familiar with this procedure?
Patient: Not really, can you explain it to me?
Doctor: Of course. During the procedure, you will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia. We will then make a 4-cm skin incision for the main port in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line.
Patient: Okay, I see.
Doctor: A wound retractor will be used to allow the insertion of a flexible thoracoscope, endoscopic autosuturing device, and vessel-sealing device via the main port incision. This will also allow us to extract the specimen after the operation.
Patient: Hmm, I understand.
Doctor: During the operation, we found an incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and middle lobe, as well as abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, we carried out a modified marionette technique.
Patient: What does that involve?
Doctor: First, an Internal organ retractor was inserted into the thoracic cavity using a clip applier. This allowed the retractor to grasp the targeted lung parenchyma properly.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Second, we prepared two sets of looped 1-0 nylon-threaded 18-gauge injection needles. These needles were optimally pierced through the thoracic wall separately.
Patient: And then what happened?
Doctor: Finally, both ends of the 1-0 nylon thread attached to the Internal organ retractor were pulled out through the looped nylon. This allowed us to perform the procedure more effectively.
Patient: I see. So, what are the follow-up requirements for this procedure?
Doctor: You will need regular check-ups and monitoring to ensure that the tumor has been completely removed and that there are no complications. We will provide you with more information regarding your follow-up appointments.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the explanation.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. We're here to help.
Patient: I think I understand everything now. Thanks again.
Doctor: No problem, take care, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment.","S: The patient confirmed a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, measuring 28 mm.

"Doctor: Hello! You mentioned that you came in for an evaluation and treatment for eyebrow alopecia. Can you tell me more about that and if you've experienced any other hair loss on your body?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've noticed my eyebrows have been thinning, but I haven't experienced hair loss anywhere else on my body.
Doctor: Alright. Have you done anything to your eyebrows in the past, like plucking them with tweezers?
Patient: Yes, I used to shape my eyebrows by plucking them with tweezers.
Doctor: Do you have any other medical conditions or concerns that you'd like me to be aware of?
Patient: No, I don't have any other medical conditions.
Doctor: Okay, let me examine your eyebrows and other areas on your body to check for any signs of alopecia. *Examines patient* I see sparse and thin black hairs on your eyebrows but no signs of hair loss elsewhere, such as your frontal hairline or temporal area. 
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Based on my examination, I'm diagnosing you with idiopathic eyebrow hypotrichosis. I'm going to prescribe you a bimatoprost 0.03% solution to apply to the affected areas daily. 
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Just so you know, improvement in your eyebrow hypotrichosis will be gradual, so you'll need to be patient. I'd like to see you for periodic follow-up visits every two months to monitor your progress.
Patient: Alright, that sounds reasonable.
Doctor: *During follow-up visits* How has your compliance with the daily application of the bimatoprost 0.03% solution been?
Patient: I've been using it once a day as you instructed.
Doctor: Great! I can see increased hair growth and thickening of your eyebrow hairs. Have you experienced any treatment-associated side effects?
Patient: No, I haven't had any side effects from the treatment.
Doctor: That's excellent! After eight months, it looks like you have complete regrowth of your eyebrows. We'll continue with the daily topical treatment of bimatoprost 0.03% solution to maintain these results.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm really happy with the progress and the treatment.","S: The patient, a female with no significant medical history, presented with the chief complaint of eyebrow thinning, specifically noting no other areas of hair loss on her body. She reported a history of eyebrow plucking, which could be relevant to her current condition.
O: Physical examination revealed sparse and thin black hairs on the eyebrows with no signs of hair loss on the frontal hairline or temporal areas. No other abnormalities were noted during the examination. The patient has been using bimatoprost 0.03% solution daily as prescribed, with no reported side effects.
A: The primary diagnosis is idiopathic eyebrow hypotrichosis. The patient's history and clinical findings support this diagnosis, with no evidence of other dermatological or systemic diseases contributing to the hair loss. The prognosis is good, given the positive response to treatment observed during follow-up.
P: The management plan includes continued daily application of bimatoprost 0.03% solution to the affected areas to maintain hair regrowth. The patient is scheduled for periodic follow-up visits every two months to monitor progress and adherence to the treatment regimen. Education on the gradual nature of treatment response and encouragement of patient compliance have been emphasized. No referral to other specialties is needed at this time.","S: The patient reports noticing thinning of the eyebrows but no other hair loss elsewhere on the body.

"Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. I see you were admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of palpitations that started a few hours ago. Can you describe the palpitations for me?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, my heart has been beating really fast and irregularly for the past few hours. It's quite uncomfortable.
Doctor: I understand. We've done a 12-lead ECG, which suggests that you have atrial fibrillation. I also noticed in your medical history that you've been taking oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and topiramate for essential tremor in your arms. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I've had these issues before, and the medications help manage them.
Doctor: After you were admitted, we administered an intravenous dose of amiodarone to help with your current symptoms. Your new 12-lead ECG is now compatible with atrial flutter, having a cycle length of 240 ms and a 4:1 atrioventricular response.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: Atrial flutter is a different type of abnormal heart rhythm, but it's related to atrial fibrillation. The cycle length and atrioventricular response we observed indicate that your heart rhythm has changed, but it's still not regular.
Patient: I see. So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We wanted to further evaluate the underlying heart rhythm, so we performed a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) on you. This is an ultrasound of your heart to see how it's functioning.
Patient: And what did you find?
Doctor: We measured the transmitral flow using pulsed-wave Doppler and found a diastolic pattern with a normal atrial rhythm. This means that your heart is functioning relatively well despite the abnormal rhythm.
Patient: That's a relief. What do we do now?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your heart rhythm and adjust your medications as needed. It's important for you to keep taking your prescribed medications and follow up with your cardiologist regularly for further evaluation and management.
Patient: Alright, doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll make sure to follow up with my cardiologist and take my medications as prescribed.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns, do not hesitate to contact your healthcare team or come back to the emergency department. Take care and stay safe.","S: The patient, a female with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and essential tremor, presented to the emergency department with palpitations described as fast and irregular, which started a few hours prior to admission. She reports discomfort associated with these symptoms. The patient confirms ongoing treatment with oral anticoagulation therapy and topiramate.
O: Initial 12-lead ECG indicated atrial fibrillation. Post-administration of intravenous amiodarone, a follow-up 12-lead ECG showed atrial flutter with a cycle length of 240 ms and a 4:1 atrioventricular response. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) revealed a diastolic pattern with a normal atrial rhythm, indicating relatively good cardiac function despite the abnormal rhythm.
A: The primary diagnosis is atrial flutter, previously managed as atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart function is stable as evidenced by the 2D TTE findings, but the presence of atrial flutter necessitates ongoing monitoring and possible adjustment of her current therapeutic regimen.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medications as necessary. The patient is advised to adhere strictly to her prescribed medication regimen and schedule regular follow-up visits with her cardiologist. She is also instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.","S: The patient, a female with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and essential tremor, presented with palpitations that began a few hours prior to admission to the emergency department.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital due to ecchymosis on both lower extremities. Can you tell me more about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, three years before admission, I was diagnosed with ITP through laboratory tests, including antibodies against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and GP IV, and bone marrow aspiration. I was treated successfully with corticosteroids. I also have a history of nontuberculosis mycobacterial infection.
Doctor: I see. What treatment were you on before coming here?
Patient: I was taking prednisolone, clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol hydrochloride.
Doctor: Okay. I have your recent examination results here. Two weeks before admission, your platelet counts were normal, at 185 × 10^9/l. However, on admission, your laboratory findings showed a significant drop in platelet count, to 3.0 × 10^9/l. Your biochemical parameters and coagulation values were within the normal limit, and antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV were negative. Based on this, we diagnosed you with acute exacerbation of chronic ITP.
Patient: Oh, no. What will be my treatment now?
Doctor: We started you on high-dose IVIG, PSL (40 mg/day), and romiplostim (1 µg/kg). However, during the next four days, you developed respiratory failure with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of approximately 250. We performed a computed tomography (CT) on the fourth day of hospitalization, which revealed ground-glass opacities with marginal infiltration in both lung fields. This led us to diagnose you with alveolar hemorrhage. 
Patient: That's terrible. What happened next?
Doctor: As your dyspnea worsened gradually, we initiated noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) to help you breathe. On the 11th day of hospitalization, we increased the dose of romiplostim to 10 µg/kg and administered pulsed doses of methyl-PSL (1000 mg/day for 3 days) along with a second cycle of IVIG.
Patient: Did that help?
Doctor: Yes, by the 21st day of hospitalization, your platelet count recovered, and you were discharged without any complications.
Patient: That's a relief. What's my current situation?
Doctor: Your platelet count has remained normal while being treated with 12.5 mg of prednisolone. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as necessary. Make sure to attend any follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or concerns.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and will make sure to follow your instructions.","S: The patient, previously diagnosed with Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) and treated with corticosteroids, was admitted with ecchymosis on both lower extremities.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to our clinic for delivery at the 37th week of your gestation. Can you tell me a bit about your pregnancy history? 
Patient: Sure, this is my sixth pregnancy. I have two children and had three abortions. I also had one previous cesarean section delivery.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I have your preoperative blood test results here. Your hemoglobin is 10.8 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) is 10.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 29 seconds, international normalized ratio is 2.3, and platelet count is 385x109/L.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We also performed a transabdominal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging on you. The results show total placenta previa and myometrial invasion to the urinary bladder at the anterior wall of your uterus. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: Yes, it can be. You mentioned earlier that you would prefer a conservative approach rather than hysterectomy in case of massive bleeding, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: After the cesarean delivery of your baby through a Pfannenstiel incision and removal of the placenta, we detected a 5-6 cm area of tissue loss at the anterior wall of the uterus. There was also bleeding from the cervix and posterior wall of the bladder.
Patient: Oh no, what did you do?
Doctor: We applied pelvic packing on the pelvic vessels for 20 minutes and sutured the bleeding sites with 1.0 polyglactine sutures. We also placed a Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter in the uterus before suturing.
Patient: And did that help?
Doctor: We filled the stomach balloon with 250 mL saline and the esophageal balloon with 400 mL saline to provide compression on the lower uterine isthmic and cervical bleeds. However, bleeding continued.
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: Bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations were planned due to the hemorrhage. During the procedure, the left external iliac artery was accidentally held and bonded as the left hypogastric artery, but we released it within a minute after distinguishing the vessels.
Patient: Oh, I see. 
Doctor: Following that, we successfully ligated the uterine and hypogastric arteries on both sides. You lost about 2000 cc of blood due to the intraoperative hemorrhage, which we measured by adding 1650 cc blood in the aspirator and counting the gauzes.
Patient: That's a lot of blood.
Doctor: Yes, it is. We gave you erythrocyte suspension (3 units preoperatively and 4 unites postoperatively) and 3 packs of fresh frozen plasma to help with the blood loss.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all that you did to help me during the delivery.","S: The patient, a 37-week pregnant woman with a history of two live births, three abortions, and one previous cesarean section, presented for delivery.
